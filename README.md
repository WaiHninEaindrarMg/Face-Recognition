# Face-Recognition 
In this project, I use YOLO for face detection and resnet (Tensorflow) for face recognition.

# Description

<h3>Face Recogntion</h3>
Face Recognition is a computer vision task that involves identifying and verifying a person's identity from digital images or video frames. It is commonly used in security systems, biometric authentication, and social media applications.

<h3>ResNet (Tensorflow) </h3>
ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition". ResNet is designed to address the problem of vanishing gradients in very deep neural networks by introducing skip connections, also known as residual connections.
