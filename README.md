## Face-Recognition 
In this project, I use YOLO for face detection and resnet (Tensorflow) for face recognition.

## Description
<h3>Face Recogntion</h3>
Face Recognition is a computer vision task that involves identifying and verifying a person's identity from digital images or video frames. It is commonly used in security systems, biometric authentication, and social media applications.

<h3>ResNet (Tensorflow) </h3>
ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a deep convolutional neural network architecture introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their paper **Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition**.
